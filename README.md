# Software Bio:
This crypto-eth-usd-gov-market- powered platform integrates a real-time NFT marketplace using the Rarible API with a programmable virtual fund IRA system. Features include:

- **IRA Dashboard**: Programmable faucet issuing 7% of $700 trillion/hour to users with charting, word economy stats, and counter tracking.
- **NFT Marketplace**: Global NFT view powered by Rarible's live API. View collections, search NFTs, and purchase using OKX or direct Mastercard/Visa checkout.
- **Real Asset Integration**: NFT images and metadata pulled directly via IPFS. Layout mirrors the open GitHub project aesthetic.
- **Decentralized UI**: No mock JSON, real token listings only.
- **Auto-Connect Wallet**: Native OKX wallet integration via browser, replacing external wallet.js entirely.
- **Custom Economy Engine**: Inflation reversal model + token valuation based on mint year and monetary history.

Perfect for decentralized economic testing, government-simulated virtual funds, and NFT integration without relying on mock data. Built for expansion.
