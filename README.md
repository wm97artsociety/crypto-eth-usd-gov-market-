This project implements a browser extension and a secure HTTPS content delivery system that:

- Rotates encryption keys every 5 seconds for 10,000 multimedia items (images, audio, video, artwork, music, poetry).
- Uses Firebase API as backend storage for encrypted content.
- Presents a real-time challenge to the user to solve within 1 second for continuous access.
- Provides defense against DDOS, IP leaks, and hacking by enforcing timed solving of the challenge.
- Supports plugin architecture for extendability.

## Features

- **Dynamic 10,000-item encryption rotation**
- **1-second user response challenge per item**
- **Multimedia content types support (images, audio, video, text)**
- **Firebase integration for content retrieval**
- **DDOS protection guard**
- **Browser extension for HTTPS traffic security**

## Installation

1. Clone or download the repo.
2. Setup Firebase project and update `src/encryption_engine.js` with your Firebase config.
3. Load the extension in your browser (chrome://extensions > Load unpacked > select folder).
4. Open demo at `demo/secure_https_demo.html` for testing.

## Usage

- The extension listens to HTTPS requests and dynamically encrypts/decrypts content.
- Users see the challenge prompt for every content item, must solve within 1 second.
- Failure to solve or DDOS attack triggers access lockout.
